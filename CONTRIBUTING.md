# How to contribute?
This is a completely free project that accepts contributions via pull requests on GitHub. This document is responsible for aligning contributions in accordance with the standards set forth therein. If in doubt, [open an issue](https://github.com/gdcmarinho/awesome-project/issues/new).

## First steps
1. Fork this repository
2. Add the links according to the standardized style in this guide
3. Submit your commits in Portuguese
4. Request the pull request
5. Enter a short summary of the added links

## Style of links, titles and link description
A link needs to be added in its most authentic form, that is:
- You cannot add link shorteners
- You cannot add redirectors (even from the application itself)
- You cannot add affiliate links (or with tracker parameters)

To maintain a general standard across all links, you should:
- Add a direct link to the content
- Add a title that matches the title of the content/tool
- Add a simple, small, non-internet-copied description of the content

Some other observations are:
- Don't add a period in the title or description of the link
- Don't write a description out of context and with adjectives
- Don't add links at the beginning or end of a category of links (always after the last element sorted alphabetically)

## Style of commits
This project follows the pattern below of commits to keep the organization:

`<type>: imperative message`
### Types of commits
- **fix** - You fixed something
- **new** - You have added new things
- **style** - You found some pattern problem in the links

### Example imperative messages for commits
- adds encoding tool
- updates broken link
- removes offline website
